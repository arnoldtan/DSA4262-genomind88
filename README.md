## Project Overview
This project aims to predict and analyse m6A modifications across cancer cell lines using machine learning methods.

## Repository Contents

- **model.joblib** : The trained machine learning model saved as a `.joblib` file for easy loading and deployment.

- **model_training.py** : Python script used to train the model.

- **predict.py** : Python script for making predictions using the trained model. It loads the model, accepts input data, and outputs predictions as a csv file.

- **requirements.txt** : A list of dependencies required to run the model and associated scripts. 

- **test_dataset.json** : A small test dataset provided in JSON format. This dataset can be used to test the modelâ€™s predictions and ensure that the setup works correctly.



## Running on AWS Instance

- [Installation of Python 3.10 and pip](#installation-of-python-3-10-and-pip)
- [Installing git and Cloning Repository](#installing-git-and-cloning-repository)
- [Installing Packages and Running the Model](#installing-packages-and-running-the-model)
- [Example Dataset and Output](#example-dataset-and-output)

## Installation of Python 3.10 and pip

Python 3.10 is required for this project to ensure compatibility with the latest packages. Please execute the following commands line by line on your AWS instance:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt install -y python3.10 python3.10-distutils
sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.10 /usr/bin/python
curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
python get-pip.py
```

Checking if everything is installed correctly:

```
python --version
# python 3.10.15
python -m pip --version
# pip 24.3.1 from /home/ubuntu/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pip (python 3.10)
```

## Installing git and Cloning Repository

To clone the repository onto the AWS instance, it is necessary to install Git. Please execute the following command:

```
sudo apt install git
```

Afterwards, you can clone the repository and navigate into it using the commands below:

```
git clone https://github.com/arnoldtan/DSA4262-genomind88.git
cd DSA4262-genomind88

```

## Installing Packages and Running the Model

To install the required packages, navigate to the Git repository folder and execute the following command:

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will read the requirements.txt file and install all the necessary Python packages listed within it.

To run the model, execute the following command:

```
python predict.py --dataset <dataset_path> --model <model_path> --output <output_path[OPTIONAL]>
```

In this command:

- `<dataset_path>` should point to your input dataset, which must be in JSON format.

- `<model_path>` refers to the location of the pre-trained model file, which must be in the Joblib format (.joblib).

- The `<output_path>` must is optional and specifies where you would like the prediction results to be saved. If you do not provide this argument, the output will default to the name `output.csv` in the same directory.

For further assistance, you can run `python predict.py -h` to view additional information.

## Example Dataset and Output

An example dataset `test_dataset.json` has been included, with its corresponding output prediction `example_output.csv`. To replicate this, execute the following command. It should return `output.csv` which is the corresponding output prediction file.

```
python predict.py --dataset test_dataset.json --model model.joblib --output output.csv
```
